    <p class="">
      Welcome to Mesh â€“ the social network thatâ€™s designed exclusively for
      university students in the Philippines. At Mesh, we believe in the power
      of authentic, open conversations, which is why our platform is built
      around the values of anonymity and free speech.

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Why Mesh?</h2>
    <p>
      University life can be both exciting and challenging. Itâ€™s a time for
      self-discovery, sharing experiences, and building connections. But
      sometimes, having a place to express freely without labels or judgments
      can be invaluable. Mesh provides that space â€“ a community where you can
      engage openly and honestly with your peers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Mesh aims to foster a safe and supportive environment where students can
      speak their minds, discuss ideas, and connect on shared experiences
      without the pressure of being identified. We believe in creating a space
      that allows every voice to be heard, supporting free and respectful
      dialogue.
